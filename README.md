🧮**Date Library – C++ OOP Console Application**
**Project 3**
A C++ console-based project that demonstrates how to build a complete and reusable date handling library using object-oriented programming principles.

The project implements a clsDate class that encapsulates date-related data and provides a rich set of methods for date construction, validation, manipulation, comparison, and calendar generation.

## 🔢 About the Project

This application defines a clsDate class that stores a date using private data members (day, month, year) and exposes controlled functionality to work with dates safely and accurately.

The library supports multiple ways to construct dates, validate them, perform date arithmetic, compare dates, and generate formatted calendar outputs, making it suitable for real-world date-related scenarios.

## 📌 Core Features (Date Library)

* **✔** Multiple Constructors:
– Default constructor initializes the object with the current system date.
– Construct a date using a string in "dd/mm/yyyy" format.
– Construct a date using day, month, and year values.
– Construct a date using day order within the year and the year.

* **✔** Date Validation & Leap Year Checking
– Validate whether a given date is valid.
– Check whether a specific year is a leap year.

* **✔** Date Formatting
– Convert a date to string format (dd/mm/yyyy).

* **✔** Calendar Generation
– Print the calendar of a specific month.
– Print the full calendar of a given year.

* **✔** Date Arithmetic
– Add a specified number of days to the current date.
– Increase or decrease dates by days, weeks, months, or years.

* **✔** Date Comparison
– Compare two dates to determine if one is before, after, or equal to the other.

* **✔** Date Difference Calculation
– Calculate the difference in days between two dates.

* **✔** Day of the Week
– Determine the day of the week for any given date.

* **✔** Encapsulation & Safety
– Day, month, and year are kept private.
– All operations are performed through class methods to ensure data integrity.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** C++
* **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Platform:** Console Application
---

## 🎯 Technical Concepts Demonstrated:

* **Class Design:**
Models a date as an object with state (day, month, year) and behavior (date operations).

* **Constructors Overloading:**
Supports multiple ways to initialize date objects depending on available input.

* **Encapsulation:**
Private data members with controlled access through methods.

* **Method Organization:**
Static vs. instance methods demonstrate utility functions vs. object-specific operations.

* **Date Arithmetic Logic:**
Implements real-world date rules such as leap years and month boundaries.
* **Utility Abstraction:**
Calendar printing and date calculations are abstracted into reusable methods.
